/* hex code: "You're already extremely familiar with decimal values: it's everyday counting! You know when you see a number (e.g. 1,432) that each digit can only be the ten values 0 through 9. Because there are only ten possibilities, we say that regular counting is base-10.
Hexadecimal counting is base-16. Each digit can be the numbers 0 through 9 or the letters a through f!"*/
